  abstract = {The power of quantum computing technologies is based on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, such as quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, or the no-cloning theorem. Since these phenomena have no classical analogue, similar results cannot be achieved within the framework of traditional computing. The experimental insights of quantum computing technologies have already been demonstrated, and several studies are in progress. Here we review the most recent results of quantum computation technology and address the open problems of the field.}
